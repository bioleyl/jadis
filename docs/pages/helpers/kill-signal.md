# ðŸ§¨ The Kill Signal

Every Jadis component provides an internal `AbortSignal` called `killSignal`. This signal is triggered automatically when the component is removed from the DOM, allowing you to safely clean up resources such as event listeners, intervals, or external subscriptions.

Hereâ€™s how you might use it to bind a DOM event:

```javascript
class ButtonComponent extends Jadis {
  static template = html`<button>Click me</button>`;

  onConnect() {
    this.getElement('button').addEventListener(
      'click',
      () => console.log('Button clicked!'),
      { signal: this.killSignal }
    );
  }
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ Note

For typical DOM event listeners, Jadis offers a built-in `on` method that simplifies this even further. It automatically registers the event and cleans it up when the component unmounts â€” so you donâ€™t need to worry about the signal manually.

```javascript
class ButtonComponent extends Jadis {
  static template = html`<button>Click me</button>`;

  onConnect() {
    this.on(this.getElement('button'), 'click', () => {
      console.log('Button clicked!');
    });
  }
}
```

# ðŸšª How to Navigate Between Pages

Jadis provides two programmatic ways to trigger navigation between pages: by using a **route name** or by using a **direct URL**. While both methods work, using route names is the recommended approach for flexibility and maintainability.

## ðŸ§­ Route Name Navigation

When defining a route, the third parameter assigns a **name** to the route. This name acts as a reference, allowing you to navigate without relying on hardcoded paths. If the route includes parameters, you must provide them when navigating.

```javascript
const myRouter = new Router();

myRouter.addRoute('/hello/:name', HelloPage.selector, { name: 'hello' });

myRouter.gotoName('hello', { name: 'World' });
```

This approach makes your code more resilient to future URL structure changes.

## ðŸš« Route Path Navigation

You can also navigate by passing the full path directly. However, this method performs no validation and assumes the path exists. Itâ€™s best to avoid this approach in favor of named routes.

```javascript
const myRouter = new Router();

myRouter.addRoute('/hello/:name', HelloPage.selector);

myRouter.gotoPath('/hello/World');
```
